# E-Commerce-back-end

## Description 
Build the back end of an e-commerce site using Express.js, MySQL, and incorporating Sequelize.

## Installation
Starter code from the class repository was used to set up this assignment. I had to fill in data to complete the models, api routes, and the server. 
I used Insomnia to test my routes to make sure everything was configured correctly.

## Usage
The purpose of this assignment was to gain a better understanding of the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites while using Express and MySQL.
With being able to help build the back end of the site, I gained further knowledge on how to build my folder structure and understanding of how all the components connect to one another.
